        <h2 class="fade-in">1. Identify the best environment to help you concentrate</h2>
        <p class="fade-in"><span class="important">Knowing where you are best able to concentrate is imperative to making the most of your time.</span> Find a place that is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable for you. Some students may be comfortable with a quiet atmosphere, while some prefer a distant activity for better concentration.</p>
        <h2 class="fade-in">2. Minimize distractions</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">It is a good idea to eliminate distractions as much as possible while studying, so you can concentrate on what's in front of you. Turn off any electronics that you don't need, especially cell phones, music listening devices, and perhaps computers (provided you don't need a computer to study your material).</p>
        <h2 class="fade-in">3. Write a to-do list</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Write down all the tasks you need to complete during your study session. This will help you stay organized and focused on what you need to accomplish.</p>
        <h2 class="fade-in">4. Schedule study time</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Arrange a schedule for study time, and keep with it. This allows you to build studying time into a habit, making you more likely to follow through on study plans.</p>
        <h2 class="fade-in">5. Make healthy snack choices</h2>
        <p class="fade-in">Choose healthy snacks like fruits, vegetables, or nuts to keep your energy levels up during your study session.</p>
        <h2 class="fade-in">6. Take breaks</h2>
        <p class="fade-in"><span class="important">Don't forget to take breaks during your study session.</span> This will help prevent burnout and keep your mind fresh.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Faiz Anwar and I am a student in class 12th. I am preparing for NEET UG 2024, which is a national level entrance exam for medical courses in India. I have always been passionate about science and biology, and I aspire to become a doctor someday.</p>
      <p>In this Website, I will share my journey of preparing for NEET UG, as well as some tips and tricks that I have learned along the way. I will also post some interesting facts and news related to the medical field that I find fascinating. I hope you will enjoy reading my website and learn something new from it.</p>
      <p>Besides studying, I also love to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JS. I have learned these skills from various online courses and tutorials, and I enjoy experimenting with different designs and features. This website is one of my projects that I have created using these technologies. I am proud of how it turned out and I hope you like it too.</p>
